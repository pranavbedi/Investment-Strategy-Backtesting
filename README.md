# Investment Strategy Backtesting

This repository contains a Python script to backtest a custom investment strategy and compare it with a simple daily investment strategy in the S&P 500.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to simulate and compare the performance of two investment strategies over a 10-year period:
1. A custom strategy that invests $10 or $20 daily based on market conditions.
2. A simple strategy that invests $10 daily regardless of market conditions.

## Data Source

The historical data for the S&P 500 index is obtained using the `yfinance` library.

## How to Use

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib
```

### Running the Script

Run the `backtest.py` script to execute the backtest.

### Results

The script will output a plot comparing the portfolio values of both strategies over time. Below is a placeholder for the graph generated by the script:

## Current Issues and Errors

### Issue 1: Discrepancy in Total Investment
- The total investment for the custom strategy is higher than expected, which might be due to the logic of investing $10 or $20 daily based on market conditions.
- **Action Needed:** Verify and ensure the logic accurately tracks the total amount invested based on market conditions.

### Issue 2: Negative Total Returns with High Positive CAGR
- The total returns for both strategies are negative, but the CAGR shows high positive values. This indicates an inconsistency in the return calculations.
- **Action Needed:** Reevaluate the return and CAGR calculations to ensure they are based on accurate initial and final portfolio values and the correct investment period.

### Issue 3: Realistic Initial Balance
- Ensure that the initial balance and daily investments are set to realistic values to reflect a typical investment scenario.
- **Action Needed:** Set a realistic initial balance and confirm that daily investment logic aligns with the strategy.
